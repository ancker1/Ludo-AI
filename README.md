# Ludo-AI

This project have been made by: **Emil Vincent Ancker**<br>
Student mail: **emanc16@student.sdu.dk**

## Methods
During this project multiple methods involving reinforcement learning, neural networks (NN) and genetic algorithms (GA) have been implemented and evaluated in order to develop an agent that plays Ludo at an acceptable level.

The following methods have been implemented:
* Q-Learning
* Genetic algorithms for learning optimal policy (using 4-bit binary encoded state-action representation)
* Genetic algorithms for evolving neural network policy

## Win rates

Win rates against random player
| Q-Learning        | GA (4-bit state-action)    | GA with NN  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 0.60      | 0.779 | 0. |
